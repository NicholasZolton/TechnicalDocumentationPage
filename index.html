				<h2>
					What is Java
				</h2>
			</header>
			<p>
				Java is a truly special language for many people, both because it is widely taught and because it is very powerful.
				If you want to learn a first programming language, Java is a brilliant choice and I would highly recommend it!
			</p>
			<p>
				Unlike some other coding languages, Java makes memory management much easier, and you don't have to worry about things like
				memory leaks or garbage collection.
			</p>

				<h2>
					Java is an Object Oriented Language
				</h2>
			</header>
			<p>
				This means that Java functions by creating classes and objects.
				Everything either has a is-a or has-a relationship with something else.
			</p>

			<p>
				One of the most beautiful things about Object Orientated Languages is the
				is the ability to model things similarly to how we perceive
				them in our minds.
			</p>

			<p>
				For example, let's say we have a car.
				It has wheels, a seat, an engine, and so much more.
				We can make each of these objects part of that car.
				We can then make a car object that has these objects as parts.
				In doing so, we can then model our perception of the car
				through code.
			</p>

				<h2>
					Classes and Objects
				</h2>
			</header>
			<p>
				Classes are like blueprints for objects.
				Objects are like the actual things that are made from the classes.
			</p>
			<p>
				We can instantiate objects by calling a class with the "new" keyword
				and adding a parenthesis after the class name.
			</p>
			<p>
				When we do this, Java actually allocates memory for the object.
				In doing so, the object is placed into the heap.
				The heap is a place where all objects are stored.
			</p>
			<p>
				On the other hand, many of the variables we see in Java aren't actually objects.
				Instead, they are simply "primitive variables", or "primitive types". 
				Instead of being stored on the "heap" these primitive variables are stored on the "stack".
			</p>
			<p>
				Here is an example of some primitive variables.
			</p>
			<code>
				int x = 5;
				int y = 10;
				int z = x + y;
			</code>
			<p>
				When the function these variables are created in
				is called, the variables are placed on the stack.
				When the function ends, the variables are removed from the stack.
			</p>
			<p>
				Now if we tried to call these variables outside of the function,
				we would get an error.
			</p> 
			<code>
				{
					int x = 5;
					int y = 10;
					int z = x + y;
				}
			</code>
			<p>

			</p>
			<code>
				System.out.println(x);
				System.out.println(y);
				System.out.println(z);
			</code>
			<p>
				This would result in an error.
			</p>

				<h2>
					Objects in Practice
				</h2>
			</header>
			<p>
				Here is a super basic example of what some code looks like with this syntax.
			</p>
			<p>
				<code>
					String name = new String();
				</code>
			</p>

			<p>
				Here we called the String constructor from the String class.
				In doing so, we created a new object. Just like we mentioned earlier,
				this object was placed on the heap. Because of this, we can use the
				object we created outside of the function it was originally
				created in, even if the function has ended.
			</p>
			<p>
				To destroy this object, we can simply remove all of our
				references to it. This is done by setting "name" to null.
				In some other languages we would be able to use the "delete" keyword,
				but in Java we can't. The delete keyword doesn't actually exist
				because the Java language uses something called a Garbage Collector.
			</p>
			<p>
				Here are some other examples of things we would make objects.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<code>
						Dog dog = new Dog();
					</code>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					<code>
						Cat cat = new Cat();
					</code>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					<code>
						Router router = new Router();
					</code>
				</li>

				<li>
					<code>
						Person person = new Person();
					</code>
				</li>

				<li>
					<code>
						Car car = new Car();
					</code>
				</li>

			</ul>

				<h2>
					Abstracts
				</h2>
			</header>
			<p>
				Abstracts are something a little bit unique.
				While they are a natural extension of the idea of classes, they also break a lot of the rules.
			</p>
			<p>
				Abstract classes are classes that cannot be instantiated.
				They are meant to be extended by other classes.
			</p>
			<p>
				This allows us to create parents of objects that
				are incomplete in nature, meaning that they don't
				have the full functionality of an object.
			</p>
			<p>
				Here's an example of an abstract class.
			</p>
			<code>
				abstract class Animal {
					public abstract void makeSound();
				}
			</code>
			<p>
				See how the makeSound() method is abstract and
				doesn't contain any code? This is because it is
				not meant to be implemented alone. It is meant to
				be extended by other classes.
			</p>
			<p>
				Here's an example of what extending that abstract method
				looks like.
			</p>
			<code>
				class Cat extends Animal {
					public void makeSound() {
						System.out.println("Meow!");
					}
				}
			</code>
			<p>
				Now when we call the makeSound() method on a Cat object,
				we get the output "Meow!".
