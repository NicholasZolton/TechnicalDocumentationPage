					What is Java
				</h2>

			<p>
				Java is a truly special language for many people, both because it is widely taught and because it is very powerful.

				<h2>
					Java is an Object Oriented Language
				</h2>
			</header>
			<p>
				This means that Java functions by creating classes and objects.
				Everything either has a is-a or has-a relationship with something else.

				<h2>
					Classes and Objects
				</h2>
			</header>
			<p>
				Classes are like blueprints for objects.
				Objects are like the actual things that are made from the classes.
			</p>
			<p>
				We can instantiate objects by calling a class with the *new* keyword
				and adding a parenthesis after the class name.

					Objects in practice

			<p>
				Here is a super basic example of what some code looks like with this tech.

				<h2>
					Abstracts
				</h2>
			</header>
			<p>
				Abstracts are something a little bit unique.
				While they are a natural extension of the idea of classes, they also break a lot of the rules.
